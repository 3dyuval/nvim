## keymaps

- [ ] create a folder lua/functions and move all functions declarations out of keymaps.lua into files to files grouped by category
- [ ] move all usage of lil and mappings from files in keymaps/*.lua to a config/keymaps.lua
- [ ] move functions declarations from keymaps/*.lua to their respective category

## TBD

- [ ] surround with and without space is backwards
- [ ] checkmate.nvim is conflicting with markdown tables
