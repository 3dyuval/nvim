# Graphite Layout & Custom Keybindings Deep Dive Prompt

## Context
I'm using a Graphite keyboard layout with custom neovim keybindings that remap standard QWERTY navigation to HAEI (H-left, A-down, E-up, I-right). My configuration replaces Vim's standard `hjkl` navigation and `ia` text objects with a more ergonomic and logical system.

## My Custom Layout Overview

### Core Navigation (HAEI)
- **H** = left (replaces `h`)
- **A** = down (replaces `j`) 
- **E** = up (replaces `k`)
- **I** = right (replaces `l`)

### Text Objects Revolution
- **R** = inner (replaces `i`) - "r" for "inneR"
- **T** = around (replaces `a`) - "t" for "around/exTernal"

### Other Key Remappings
- **X** = delete (replaces `d`)
- **W** = change (replaces `c`)
- **C** = yank/copy (replaces `y`)
- **V** = paste (replaces `p`)
- **N** = visual mode (replaces `v`)
- **Z** = undo (replaces `u`)

## Learning Goals

1. **Muscle Memory Development**: Build automatic finger positioning for HAEI navigation
2. **Text Object Mastery**: Fluently combine R(inner)/T(around) with all text objects
3. **Operation Chaining**: Seamlessly chain navigation + text objects + operations
4. **Tree-sitter Integration**: Master code-aware text objects (functions, classes, parameters)
5. **Surround Fluency**: Quick manipulation of brackets, quotes, tags using custom bindings
6. **Language-Specific Patterns**: Optimize workflows for TypeScript/JavaScript/HTML/JSON

## Deep Dive Questions

### Foundation
- How can I build the most efficient practice routine for HAEI navigation?
- What are the most common text object + operation combinations I should drill?
- How do I prevent falling back to QWERTY muscle memory during high-pressure editing?

### Advanced Integration
- What are the optimal key combination patterns for complex editing tasks?
- How can I leverage tree-sitter text objects for language-specific refactoring?
- What surround patterns should I master for web development workflows?

### Workflow Optimization
- Which editing patterns should I prioritize based on TypeScript/JavaScript development?
- How can I create muscle memory for switching between navigation and editing modes?
- What are the most efficient ways to combine multiple operations in sequence?

### Troubleshooting & Refinement
- How do I identify and fix inefficient movement patterns in my workflow?
- What metrics should I track to measure my proficiency improvement?
- How can I continue evolving this layout based on real-world usage patterns?

## Practice Challenges Needed

1. **Navigation Drills**: Specific exercises for HAEI movement patterns
2. **Text Object Combinations**: Practice scenarios for R/T with different targets
3. **Operation Sequences**: Complex editing tasks that chain multiple commands
4. **Language-Specific Scenarios**: Real-world TypeScript/JavaScript editing challenges
5. **Speed Building**: Timed exercises to build fluency and reduce cognitive load

## Success Metrics

- Navigate without conscious thought about key positions
- Execute complex editing operations as single fluid motions
- Maintain high editing speed without reverting to standard Vim bindings
- Efficiently handle code refactoring tasks using tree-sitter objects
- Seamlessly switch between navigation, selection, and editing modes
